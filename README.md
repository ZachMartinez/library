# Readdit

This is a simple library app built to specifications for the library project in The Odin Project's Javascript course. It allows users to perfom basic CRUD operations on a list of books and stores the user's data in local storage.

I'll be doing a live coding stream of me creating this app at some point. Afterwards I will post the link to the recording of the stream here.
